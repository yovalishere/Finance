For details, please check the report [HERE](https://github.com/yovalishere/Finance/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Scorecard%20Analysis/CreditRisk_Report.pdf)
### Project description
This project focuses on behavioural credit risk scorecard analysis. 5 classification models were
used for prediction performance comparison. They are :
1) Logistics Regression
2) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3) Decision tree
4) Random Forest 
5) XGBoost

### Project findings
**PAY_1** (payment delay for 1 month) and **PAY_2** (payment delay for 2 months) are the most important features found by the optimal model.

**Random forest model after hyperparameter tuning** gives the best result.<br><br>
